##Hemanshu Singh - Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


This is the assignment for Coursera Data Science class "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The assignment is to retrieve data from UCI Machine Learning Repository with "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" Data Set.

The raw data is downloaded from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

And the code in the repo (run_analysis.R) will generate the final tidy dataset: tidy_data.txt, which will contain mean value of specific measures per each subject (30 of them) and the 6 different activities.
